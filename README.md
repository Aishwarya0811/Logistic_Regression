Ledoitte, a management consulting firm, is studying the roles played by experience and
training in a system administratorâ€™s ability to complete a set of tasks in a specified
amount of time. 
Ledoitte is interested in figuring out which administrators can
complete given tasks within a specified time and those who are not.

Data are collected on the performance of 75 randomly selected administrators. 

They are stored in the file SystemAdministrators.csv (available on eLearning).

The variable Experience measures months of full-time system administrator experience,
while Training measures the number of relevant training credits. 

The outcome variable Completed is either Yes or No, according to whether or not the administrator completed
the tasks.
